<u>**Aim 2**</u> : WAP to convert given degree celsius temperature into
fahrenheit and convert that fahrenheit temperature
into kelvin by implementing multilevel inheritance:
Class P -> Class Q -> Class R
- Class P has following members: temperature
attribute in float
- Class Q has following members: toFehrenheit()
method
- Class R has following members: toKelvin() method
